# Flax's Arma Server Tool 2 (FAST2)



**_INTRO_**

An extensive rewirte of FAST. The UI needed updating and the code was messy and inefficient. This new and hoprefully improved FAST2 has more features and better stability than FAST. As before I decided to build FAST to help automate and speed up the deplotment of Arma 3 servers on Windows.  Thanks go out to Optix for his Remote Arma Server tool that gave me some ideas for my tool. Also, a massive thank you to Kju for his continued bug reporting and ideas. 
 

**_PREREQUISITES_**

- Steam account with valid copy of Arma 3.
- Basic understanding of Arma 3 dedicated servers.

_**ISSUES AND FEEDBACK**_

I'll monitor the BI Forums thread as best as i can but I will use this GitHub Repo for bugs, issues and feature suggestions. [Discord also avliable here](https://discord.gg/tkS4evC).
 

_**DEV BRANCH WARNING**_

Due to the available server builds on steam, to install a dev branch server you must install the main Arma 3 application dev branch then launch using the included server binaries. Due to the way SteamCMD works this means that any mods that the account used to install the server is subscribed to will also be downloaded and updated when using Dev Branch. Currently these mods are mot detected/ added to F.A.S.T. but this will be added in future.
